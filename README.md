Given a geographic region(suppose that the region is divided in a grid composed of 30 squares), points are known where can install alarm sirens. For each point the area where the siren sound is heard(11 sirens), and the installation cost at that point. Determine the minimum cost solution until the whole region be covered with the sirens
